# Multiple Blink
The codes in each folder will blink two LED's at seperate speeds at the same time on the microcontrollers listed.  The LEDs will blink at set speeds in the code.  These codes are dependent on the MSP430.h library in C.

## MSP430G2553
The code for the MSP430G2553 will blink the LED at P1.0 at a set speed of 10000 and the LED at P1.6 at a sppeed of 50000.  If desired the speed can be changed in the code by changing the values of i and n.

## MSP430F5529
The code for the MSP430G2553 will blink the LED at P1.0 at a set speed of 10000 and the LED at P4.7 at a sppeed of 50000.  If desired the speed can be changed in the code by changing the values of i and n.
