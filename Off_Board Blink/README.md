# Off_Board Blink
The code in the folder is able to blink two LEDs on a breadboard for the MSP430G2553.  The chip must be removed from the MSP430G2553 and put on the breadboard.  The circuit created requires resistors to lower the amperage going to the LEDS, and 2 LEDS since the code used is for multiple blink.
